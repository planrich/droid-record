# Android Record

## Getting started


## Null and default values

By default every value on a table gets a default value in the java objects constructor. 
This is due to the fact that allowing null objects to be deserialized from a table row can result in
a null pointer exception.

I'm often finding myself doing the following checks:
~~~
if (string == null || string.equals("")) { ... }
~~~

If this behaviour is desired you should specify it in the migration file:
~~~
fields: {
  pony: {
    type: 'string',
    null: true,
    ...
  }
}
~~~

Whenever you set any value explicitly to null (= farm.setPony(null); ) and save this
record the value will stay null.
